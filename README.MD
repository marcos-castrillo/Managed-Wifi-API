# Managed Wi-Fi

This project has a main goal - to create a simple but useful and user-friendly interface to manage Wi-Fi networks on Windows 8 and Windows 10.

It's based on the next .NET class library:
[Managed Wifi API](https://managedwifi.codeplex.com/)

The library uses the Native Wifi API, available since Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 (in a limited fashion, and only after applying a hotfix provided in KB article 918997). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

The original WifiExample was modified, adding a view using Windows Forms.

There's an image of the view on the Wiki of this project.

This code was developed for my Preparatory Project, developed during the second semester of 2016/2017 academic year.

There I try to apply what I've learned working on this project and I've moved from Windows Forms to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF)
