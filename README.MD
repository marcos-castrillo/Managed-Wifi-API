Managed Wi-Fi

This project has a main goal - to create a simple but useful and user-friendly interface to manage Wi-Fi networks on Windows 8 and Windows 10.

It's based on the next .NET class library:
Managed Wifi API (https://managedwifi.codeplex.com/)

The library uses the Native Wifi API, available since Windows Vista and Windows XP SP2 (in a limited fashion, and only after applying a hotfix provided in KB article 918997). Older versions of Windows are not supported.

The original WifiExample was modified, adding a view using Windows Forms.

This code was developed for the subject Preparatory Project, developed in Wroclaw (Poland) during the second semester of 2016/2017 academic year.

Currently, I have moved to the PrioriFi project, where I try to apply what I learned working on this project and I moved from Windows Forms to Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF):
